Briefly summarize the KEY FINDINGS, strengths and potential limitations of this work

Key Findings:

Strength:
uses complementary VQA pairs
PJ-X does not require domain knowledge

introspective vs justification

faster than MCB model

Limitations:

Did not compare with: VQA-HAT
unidirectional LSTM?

The authors of the paper present a novel model for the VQA task, which incorporates 2 modes of reasoning, visual and textual. This is
